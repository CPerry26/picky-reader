Every time I take a break in between books, it always feels too long. This one had a very intriguing setup. While it's not the first time we've investigated a crime from the past, this one had a nice twist, where we hear many different versions of the events from the different characters. So while Poirot is putting the pieces together, we can also do our own investigation in parallel. This keeps you invested in the story even when Poirot isn't in the picture, because you have your own story to follow. This plot is pretty complex too, with characters you're not sure if you truly understand or like. Who do you believe? Who is lying? Even later in the story it's still unclear whether or not you'll be able to pick the culprit. Which to me, in the end, was a bit underwhelming. It was really down to two options, and either felt fairly obvious if you were paying attention. With that being said, it was still very enjoyable, with well written characters and a complex plot. I would continue highly recommending Poirot and this book.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Very complex characters. Both the main actors in the original crime were extremely deep and hard to understand.<br/>+ The plots with Poirot solving old crimes are really unique.<br/>+ Poirot continues to shine as always.<br/>+ Storytelling technique was different this time around.<br/>- Ending wasn't bad, but was underwhelming to me.<br/><br/>Overall, Poirot rules, Christie is the GOAT, and if you aren't reading her, what are you doing? 4/5 stars.",,,1,0

Even as a fan of the games since Halo 2 back in 2004, I was not expecting to like this as much as I did. I've never been a big lore guy, and to be honest I mainly only remember big moments from some of the games (Halo 3, Reach, and a bit of 5). But if I knew it would have been as cool or as deep as this, I would've jumped in much earlier! What starts as a somewhat non-sci-fi story quickly becomes much grander in scale, and slowly reveals the deeper Halo lore without overwhelming you with too many details too early. The characters are unique, and experience great growth over the whole story. Some of those characters are actually the most interesting part of the book, if you've played the games you'll have some preconceived notions going in, but you see a different side of some of the characters you're familiar with that make them more dynamic. The story went in a way I wasn't expecting and it was cool to see the lore I am familia with poke it's head throughout. I would say my only two real complaints are that the pacing meanders a bit in the 50-60% mark, and the start can take some getting used to. I know many recommend to start in release order and not chronological but since I already owned this, I started here. As a newbie, a took a bit in the beginning to get used to the terminology and descriptions. But if you push through, there's real quality here. I'm looking forward to reading the larger universe! 4/5 stars.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Characters are interesting.<br/>+ The story starts small and slowly becomes larger and more complex over time.<br/>+ The world is built slowly but surely and really pays off towards the end. I'm officially hooked!<br/>- The pacing meanders a bit in the middle.<br/>- The beginning can be a bit overwhelming at first (story of much fantasy and sci-fi, but that's the fun!).<br/><br/>I'm really looking forward to continuing this series, and I'm definitely hooked. If you're a fan of the games, I'd highly recommend. Even if you're not, there's a lot to love here, and Halo is amazing so get into the games too nerd! 4/5 stars.",,,1,0

That start is so odd, it feels almost like another author writing a preface. But once you meet Dupin, it picks up pretty quickly and doesn't stop. My friends know I'm much more of a fan of cerebral detectives over the more modern action detective. I find them so much more interesting and impressive when you have to use brains over brawn. Dupin is this to a tee, and it makes sense why he is the inspiration for Sherlock, Poirot, and I'm sure more. He very logically breaks down the crime into digestible pieces that all fit together into the very unexpected reveal of the culprit. The narrator fits well and adds another nice dynamic with Dupin, much like Watson or Japp. My only real complaint besides the start, and this is how I feel about a lot of short stories, is I wish it was a bit longer. I like to settle into the mystery and have a little bit more flushed out before the reveal. But if you're into short stories, mysteries, classics, or all of the above, read this. It's one of the first mystery novels, and helped birth the genre and golden age detective.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Dupin is an interesting character, who's more approachable than Sherlock but very methodical and logical.<br/>+ The crime was interesting.<br/>+ The reveal was very unexpected.<br/>- The start was very odd and jarring.<br/>- The story ends a bit too quickly for me.<br/><br/>Easy 4 stars, will definitely check out the other 2 Dupin stories.

This was a fun one, and sadly seems like the last entry in the series as 2023 is almost over. I would happily check back in with Ian, Dickerson, Crawford, and Doyle again. These stories are rich in historical detail, and the crimes are well written and enjoyable. You won't necessarily walk away with the Christie WOW, but that's okay because they are high quality regardless. This one had a solid crime, that was interwoven well with the larger overarching story of Ian's past. I would honestly say that's my only major complaint: there's not much resolution for the story we've been exploring for 3 books. So I walk away feeling a bit incomplete. It feels like a larger thread is missing. I get that this might just be a period of Ian's life we were lucky to read about, leaving room for you to know there are future untold stories. But for something so important to his character, it feels a bit like a let down to get no real resolution. With that being said, the rest was great. The drama this time around felt a lot more natural, and the underlying decisions and behavior felt a lot more believable. Ian was clearly overwhelmed in this book, and it made sense why he made the decisions he did. The writing and pacing was the same as the other books; all really digestible. If you're a historical mystery fan, I would highly recommend reading this series. It has good historical detail, good characters, and solid mysteries. I'm sad that it's over (still hoping there's maybe 1 more book in the works that concludes the story), but I'm glad I read it.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Characters are well written, and their character growth pays off.<br/>+ Decisions and behavior felt natural and earned this time around.<br/>+ The crime was well written and mysterious in how it related to Ian's past.<br/>- The ending was a bit of a let down. There wasn't much resolution on some big points and it feels like there's a bigger piece missing from this overall story.<br/><br/>I hope we get another book, but if not, I'm satisfied with having read the serious.

The writing and McLevy were as good as usual, and we got to see a new side of McLevy we hadn't seen before. However, a lot of the storylines I quite frankly wasn't interested in. I didn't care about Jean's love story or Mulholland's. I get characters need to grow, and I do like some romance in the books I read, but these felt so unnecessarily forced and honestly annoying. Mulholland especially was a love sick puppy who just became a chore to read, especially considering his somewhat conflicting decisions considering his experience on the force. I get that was the point, but it wasn't believable to me. On the flip side, the main plot was interesting, and how it interwove with McLevy's past. The ending was a bit of a disappointment. While there was a major conclusion for McLevy himself, I felt let down with how laissez-faire the wrap up was considering McLevy's sense of justice. All that being said, I enjoyed it enough, but I didn't walk away loving it nearly as much as the first book. I will check out the next book, as this feels more like a hurdle than expectation going forward. If you like historical mysteries with interesting characters, and history, I'd recommend you give this a shot.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ McLevy is still great.<br/>+ The main plot and McLevy's past were well explored and interwoven nicely.<br/>+ McLevy's character development continues to be good.<br/>- The side stories or characters roles in the story were overdone and unenjoyable. This is personal preference though.<br/>- The ending felt a little underwhelming and didn't pack much of a punch.<br/><br/>Enjoyable enough, 3/5 stars.<br/>",,,1,0

While overall it was fine, there were parts that were good, and there were also parts that felt really un-Bond and had some odd art. I've never read the full on novels but I've seen every Bond movie, and there was definitely scenes from other stories in this one (for example License to Kill). While these may have been nods, or scenes from the actual Live and Let Die, they were quite jarring and didn't feel like I was reading the original story. Bond isn't necessarily big on plot, but I did find the backstory and stories to be interesting and engaging. Keep in mind though, the main driving force was sort of a dud and goes nowhere in the end. The characters were mostly good, with a couple of underwhelming appearances later in the story. The art was solid throughout, but some of the facial expressions were beyond cringe-y. They felt so unnatural and forced they actually took you out of the story. Overall, this one didn't read as fast paced as I would've liked, and it was an okay experience. If you're a Bond fan, there are better comic versions out there (see Ellis), but if you've read them all and are looking for a distraction, you can check this one out.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Main Bond characters were solid.<br/>+ The story starts well, and has good momentum in the first half.<br/>+/- The pacing dies off in the second half.<br/>+/- Facial expressions can be laughable.<br/>+/- Main plot point is a dud.<br/>+/- Secondary characters really vary.<br/>- Tons of inner monologue and text.<br/><br/>So a mixed bag for me, 3/5.",,,1,0

I'm unfamiliar with the BBC show, so I didn't know anything about the characters or world going in. But boy oh boy, does this feel like a well realized world. Leith feels like a living, breathing historical place. The characters were complex and well drawn, where you learn little bits and pieces of them but enough ambiguity exists to keep you interested long term. As for the plot, I really didn't enjoy it for a lot of it. Not because it was poorly written! But because it was playing with established history that clearly wasn't real, and apologies, but that stuff irks me. There was a nice twist however that was both unexpected and pleasing that I completely changed my tune by the end!

Reading a book or series where you know so much about it, at least so many opinions, is tough. On the one hand you can recognize why its so beloved, but on the other there's these overly lofty expectations that are impossible to meet. So while there was I lot I really liked in this, there's a few things that brought my enjoyment down. That's not to say it wasn't good, it was. Well written, with well drawn characters, and an interesting world. But, in my opinion, it takes a while to get the world building really going, and some of the character storylines were just flat and uninteresting. But the heights this book hit are very high. The dialogue is great, and some of the characters are so well written (for example Byaz) that you truly don't know how they'll act in any situation. That keeps you intrigued in any situation they're involved in. I think if you go into this without spoilt expectations, and enjoy a good start to a fantasy, you'll really enjoy this. There's a lot to like here!<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Great characters: Sand, Byaz, the Northmen, Logen to name a few.<br/>+ The world is interesting and by the end well developed. You'll have a better sense of the history and politics.<br/>+ Well written dialogue.<br/>+ The pacing is relatively quick, with only a few chapters lasting 20+ pages, so the story moves pretty fast.<br/>+/- The world building is good, but takes a while to get there. I felt like I didn't start to gain a better understanding from good exploration until the last third of the book.<br/>+/- The ending sort of felt flat to me. The big action scene was AWESOME. But, there wasn't really anything to made me clamor for book 2. That's fine, but usually you're left with some nugget to keep you intrigued. To be clear, not a bad ending, but didn't grab me totally as I would've liked.<br/>- Some of the character storylines were just so meh. None of the characters are bad at all, but I really just could not care about Jezal's storyline, nor Ardee's. The romance did nothing for me, and honestly felt forced and unnecessary. <br/><br/>Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say you should give this book a try. It's a good fantasy novel with well written characters and interesting world. While I suspect this series will get darker in the next two books, this one wasn't too grimdark. There's violence, but it's not overly done or gratuitous. Even if the characters are not nice people, they have some redeeming qualities that have you rooting for them. Give it a shot! 4/5 stars.<br/><br/>Also, give me the Northmen and Logen reunion damnit.",,,1,0

Edinburgh Dusk was another good entry in this series. The mystery was interesting, and the killer interludes legitimately made my skin crawl at some points (as intended). I felt the side characters this time around were better, and made the plot more engaging. In the previous book it turned more into a thriller because it was less built as a mystery due to the story structure and limited characters. But with the introduction of Arthur Conan Doyle (I loved the Sherlock references) transformed this into much more of a mystery than thriller. That kept me invested in the plot and the characters. So why only 4 stars? I honestly think it's the storytelling format. Due to the killer interludes and the smaller set of characters, there isn't much mystery in who the killer could be, it's all delegation to side characters and little investigation. That makes the resolution just kind of happen with no fanfare because there's so much build up for you as the reader to think about the culprit. To me, this is less desirable than some fireworks as there's no big reveal or the dopamine from being right. But, it's still a good book, and I would recommend for historical fiction and mystery fans.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Main characters are good. The family drama again was a bit unbelievable and forced, but it was more subtle this time.<br/>+ The killer interludes were creepy.<br/>+ The plot was engaging.<br/>- The resolution just kind of happens in the last chapter.<br/>- The killer is relatively obvious.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this for mystery and historical fans. The characters are good, and so are the plots, with engaging killer interludes to add some spice to a typical structure. 4/5 stars. I'll definitely read the (sadly) last book in the series.",,,1,0

I can't even believe I've read that many so far and that I'll be finishing the series next year! This one sort of surprised me in some ways. For example, I had a much bigger emotional connection this time around. No spoilers, but I just wanted to give Linda a hug and tell her everything would be okay. As always, Christie presents you with a facade at the beginning of the book. You believe you know the characters in the world and their feelings and motivations. But as you delve deeper, you discover the individuals are truly three dimensional. Is Arlena a bad wife? What is her husband really like? You'll discover that truth sometimes is a matter of perspective. Realizing at the end of the story you feel differently about many characters is a testament to Christie's writing skill and great character work. But it's not just the characters we're here for, it's the crime! And this one didn't disappoint. What starts as a seemingly personal and passionate murder starts to change over time. It expands and throws some interesting curves along the way to keep you guessing. Who is the killer? And did the killer's motivations actually match your thoughts? You'll have to read and find out ;)<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Papa Poirot, plain and simple. A complex main character who is passionate about justice in his own way, but also a man who cares about others.<br/>+ Character work is top notch. My thoughts changed about the characters as the story progressed.<br/>+ An intriguing plot that expands and changes over the course of the book.<br/>+ A solid resolution, which always a great way to end a mystery.<br/><br/>24th book, and another 5 star. It's been a pleasure to find an author and character who resonate so well with me and my interests. I whole heartedly recommend Christie's work, Papa Poirot, and this book. Easy 5 stars.",,,1,0

I went into this expecting a typical historical mystery: a crime that's solved from classic detective techniques, with some cool characters and interesting world. What I got was so much more. The crime starts small, and becomes more complex as the plot moves. The characters are well drawn, and are all three dimensional. We also get some interesting interludes of the culprit, who acts as a mirror for other characters we know. It felt like a potential outcome for some of their lives had they made different choices. That dichotomy was really impressive to read. So why only 4 stars? Well, the plot itself was good, but a bit underwhelming on the mystery side since we as readers know the culprit but DI Hamilton does not. That may have been my own expectations getting in the way, but it didn't blow me away. However, going into the next book, I'll be expecting more of this style and I think I'll enjoy it a bit more. Besides the plot, I felt some of the moments (especially those between characters) felt contrived. I think for the most part this is because I didn't truly believe them. Some moments of drama felt forced and not something earned between the two characters. That took out some of the experience for me. But overall, this was great. It's one of the strongest and well written historical mysteries with a modern twist I've read. I would definitely recommend if you like historical mysteries!<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Characters are well drawn.<br/>+ Historical period feels real.<br/>+ The killer interludes were well done and provided good dichotomy between our characters.<br/>- There was no real mystery, more of a thriller where the main character has to figure it out but the reader already knows.<br/>- Some moments felt contrived to push the character development instead of feeling truly earned.<br/><br/>4/5 stars, I'll definitely continue in the series.

I always appreciate when Poirot is involved from the start, especially when he's uncomfortable. While my socks weren't knocked off, this was still a very good entry. One of the more interesting aspects is that the characters are very mysterious in this one. You're not sure who's acting and who's genuine. That makes for an intriguing twist that's different than most other books so far. The story is similar. It starts small and seemingly simple, but slowly becomes more complex as the plot moves. Maybe that was intentional! You spend a lot of time focused on the characters and the plot, and less on the potential culprit. So, if you like Poirot, of course, pick up the next entry.

I felt that sometimes the pacing was a bit inconsistent and there was sometimes too much scientific jargon that I ended up skimming. I mistakenly entered this one thinking it was more of a sci-fi thriller, which may have contributed to my feeling of pacing inconsistency, but the end of this book certainly flew. The world was interesting and full of futuristic changes that felt realistic in our own future. Logan was an intriguing main character who goes through a large transformation throughout the book, which feels really earned by the end. His changes felt natural based on what happened in the book, and never felt like something contrived for plot. Crouch's writing is easy to digest, and he does good job giving the highlights of important concepts. This book also had a couple of unexpected twists as well! That made the last 90 pages a lot easier to invest in. I would definitely recommend to sci-fi fans, and those looking for a change of pace from their usual fair.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Characters are good, especially the Ramsay clan.<br/>+ The world was familiar enough it felt grounded, but also unique in it's futuristic changes.<br/>+ The plot was cool. The ending wasn't unexpected, but definitely earned. I don't read much sci-fi and I was invested throughout.<br/>- There is sometimes too much scientific jargon. I think it's meant to show Logan's changes throughout the novel, but it still felt overdone sometimes. So much so I ended up skimming those sentences because I just felt blah.<br/>- The pacing was somewhat inconsistent. There were times a big thing would happen, and then we spent a lot of time at the bottom and ramping up again. Once it gets going though, it goes.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good 4/5 novel.

This one is chalk full of Poirot, with a Marple, Parker Pyne, and standalone included as well. I'm on record that I think short stories are not Christie's strong point. Her talent, to me, really lies in longer books where she can flesh out the characters and the plot. The stories go by a bit quick and the characters and plot end up feeling much more flat than her normal novels. Obviously Poirot in particular is meant to be the ultimate detective, but the reveals just sort of happen in the short stories and don't feel earned. As a reader, we want to feel we have the opportunity to solve the crime even if we can't. With these there's very little evidence given so you lack the opportunity. As I've said before, I think the Sherlock short stories are far superior (with the novels being weaker). If you're interested in Poirot, I think there's better places to start, but if you're already 20 books in like me, of course you should read it.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ All of the main characters are good (Poirot, Marple, and Pyne). Pyne was better than I expected.<br/>+ The stories are varied in crimes and non-criminal mysteries.<br/>+ Fast paced.<br/>- The standalone mystery is beyond pointless. It's like 7 pages and not even a real story.<br/>- Reveals tend to just happen so the only real investment is if you're a fan of the main character.<br/><br/>Pretty quick overall even with it being okay.

Until about the 2/3 mark, it was sitting at a 3 star for me, but I didn't enjoy the last third enough that I brought the rating down to a 2 star. There is good to be found here, like the magic system and the humor. But, there is a lot that just didn't work it outweighed that good. For the most part, I found the characters quite shallow besides Cade, and there was a lot of presumption that a connection to those characters, and the characters connections to each other was present, but I never actually felt that while reading the book. You don't meet some of the characters until 2/3 through the book, so how do we have enough time to form any connection? <br/><br/>This book also relies a lot on telling and not showing. We're continuously told how bad the world is, and how bad the characters are, but we barely see that on the page. Just because we're told about one bad thing happening, does not necessitate that the whole world is bad. It's just a giant generalization. An example of this is in how we're continuously told by the narrator that ""we're the bad guys"". But they don't really do anything bad. Sure, is there death and killing? Of course, but that's no different than any other fantasy books. Many fantasy good guys kill people, but we don't look at them as bad. This made it hard to really believe anything in the story as you're instantly taken out of the moment when something like that happens.<br/><br/>The story is also quite convoluted to me. What starts as a relatively simple premise, gets quickly more and more complicated. This is normally a good thing, but here, it ended up becoming full of holes. We're told that one of the characters is an incredibly good investigator, yet he misses things that should be obvious to provide a plot twist to a reader. That doesn't really work in reality though. You end being completely aware of this happening. The world-building is relatively minimal as well. There's no hints that will be useful later, or planning on what's going to happen. Just magically in the moment the characters figure it out. That means it's hard to invest in the plot, and you feel conveniences are used to resolve the story.<br/><br/>As I said, the writing is solid, the humor is good, and the magic system is interesting. But there was a lot more to critique. I would still like to read Greatcoats, and I think this is more attributed to this story than the author for me overall. Regardless, I would struggle to recommend this to others. On to the next!<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Writing is solid.<br/>+ Magic system is unique and interesting.<br/>+ Humor is good.<br/>- Lack of character depth and development.<br/>- Lots of tell and not show.<br/>- Plot development is lackluster. <br/>- Multiple contrivances to resolve the story and plot points.<br/><br/>2/5 stars.",,,1,0

I really thought I had it this time, and similar to the last time I felt that, I got something right just not the whole picture. But honestly that's better, because it enhances my reading experience every time. As per usual, the characters are great, and the story is well written. Similar to the recent entries, the crime seems simple and the suspect pool short, but it slowly gets more complex as the story progresses. As Poirot always say, it's all about the psychology! To be honest at this point I keep running out of words to say. Christie is the GOAT, and she just gets me as a reader.

Nothing that knocked my socks off, but that's okay, it didn't need to be. The history of the time period is so rich and fully detailed throughout the book, you'll be wrapped up in it all. While there is a mystery in this book (in that there's a crime and an unknown culprit), it's really a backdrop more to the conflict at the time and the character's journeys. The reason I say that is because unlike a typical mystery, you won't be receiving a lot of clues and trying to put the pieces together. It's a pretty simple mystery overall and the culprit isn't a major surprise. But I don't believe it's meant to be. It really is to spur the character's journeys throughout the book. The problems for me really steam from some of the characters and pacing. There are some really good characters (see Iain), but also some really unenjoyable ones (like Hector). There's also chunks of the book that feel like not much is happening plot wise due to waiting on some character to reveal a new piece of the puzzle. This made it feel like the pacing was start/stop, and that some of the characters didn't have much agency. Even with my criticisms, the writing was good, and I was engrossed in the history that I still had a great time. If you're into historical fiction with interesting history and characters, with a dash of mystery, try it out!<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Great writing.<br/>+ The world and history was very engrossing.<br/>+ 3D main character. Iain was so fun to read about and I really felt for him.<br/>- Weak mystery subplot that was predictable.<br/>- Some of the characters were a bit weak like Hector. To me we're supposed to be sympathetic to him but in all honestly, he's just a bad guy. His purpose in the story is to just drip feed information to the reader and move the plot along which makes him feel like a device and not a believable character. This made the story and Iain lack agency and that we were just waiting until it was decided to move along.<br/><br/>This was still an enjoyable book, but I would beware of the criticisms as it may affect your reading experience. I still think it's worth a go as it has good writing and an engrossing bit of history. Just be prepared for a weaker mystery and some missable characters.",,,1,0

The first half was much the same, I was really into the characters, the story, and the world. But in the second half, or at least last ~40%, this took a nose dive for me. I started to find holes in what was going on, plot conveniences, and realized the characters were a lot less interesting than at first glance. The writing is still great, and the author is great at coming up with intriguing ideas. But, the execution has always been mixed for me. I think the perfect way to read this book is to really suspend disbelief. Do not think too deeply about the characters, world, or plot. Just go along for the ride with Aiden. <br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Intriguing idea for a story. There's a nice little twist that adds some spice in the latter third of the book.<br/>+ Aiden's struggle and coming to terms with each of hosts was fun to read.<br/>- The characters don't have much depth once you start poking around. The Footman for example, starts as a really intriguing character. But in the second half you realize that he has no purpose in the story at all.<br/>- There's a lot of holes in the second half. For example, something happens which is meant to create a sense of tension and feeling of running out of time. But if you remember the rules that were outlined earlier in the book, it completely defeats the tension because you know there's way more time than you're led to believe.<br/>- The ending, similar to Devil and the Dark Water, is just not great. Once again, something somewhat out of character happens, and the book ends. You're left being like ""Seriously?"". This one is more believable, but I felt like it was a step too far beyond belief.<br/><br/>As you can tell, this one was more mixed than Devil and the Dark Water. Maybe I was more in tune this time around that I noticed more, but I felt the tension and execution was better in Devil and the Dark Water. The story started strong, but eventually it's really easy to pick a lot of holes in the characters and plot. I feel this is true with a lot of time travel stories unless the rules are very strict, which is not actually true here. If you can suspend disbelief easily, I think you'll enjoy this. Otherwise, I think you'll probably also feel pretty mixed. Although the ending isn't good, I would recommend Devil and the Dark Water over this one. 3/5 stars.",,,1,0

This is the perfect example of sometimes just not being in the mood for something, and its worth coming back and trying again. I tried to read this book for the first time in the last 6-8 months, and I was just overwhelmed with the terminology and a bit burnt out. I decided to pick this back up a few weeks ago, and I'm so happy I did. What a ride all around. The character development in this book is top notch. If you take a shot from the first 50 pages, and then another in the last 50 pages, you'll be amazed at how much the characters have changed. The world is unique, with it's own terminology and systems. While it may be overwhelmed at first, eventually you'll put the pieces together, and there's a lot of similarities with our own world from a people perspective. While this is a naval fantasy book, and there's a lot of time spent on a ship, but there's also plenty of action and plot development. If you enjoy great fantasy, with incredible character development, then this is for you. Don't be turned off by it being naval fantasy or that it could be complex, it's worth the journey. <br/><br/>To give you an example of why I think you should read this book: I had a preconceived notion or judgement about alcoholics. One of the characters has this behavior at the start of the book. That really turned me off at the start due to that judgement, and some personal experience. When I came back, I jumped right in from where I ended so I actually forgot about that fact. When I realized it, not only was I invested in everything, but I also came at it from a different perspective (essentially a different version of the character). It made me confront something about myself that I wasn't really aware of. That change not only affected me in real life, but had me even more invested in the growth of this character. I felt connected on a deeper level. That's good character growth!<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Character growth is amazing.<br/>+ Meas. What a character. A strong woman without needing to try or be in your face about it. A true leader. She makes everyone better around her by lifting them up. <br/>+ The world is complex but unique.<br/>+ The action is good and keeps you invested. You get the perspective of the untrained and battle hardened which is a nice mix.<br/>+ The naval details and boat journey was engaging throughout.<br/>- The final battle was a bit anticlimactic. It was over pretty fast. It was meant to be a somewhat personal moment for the characters that ended up falling a little flat. Now there was a moment that hints at things for the future, but I was wishing for a bit more.<br/><br/>Due to the final battle, this sits at a 4.5/5 for me, but that's a bit pedantic. A fantastic book through and through. I'm happy I confronted some of my own judgements and came back to this book.

A Christie book always recharges the reading juices. They're easily digestible, fast paced, and have great characters. This was no different in entry number 19. I felt this time Christie wrote one of the most complex set of characters. Mrs. Boyton on the surface is a very mean, cruel, and despicable character. But similar to other Poirot novels, the psychology gets revealed over time and reveals layers to a character who at first seems very one dimensional. This made the whole story engrossing as you learn about all the characters, what makes them tick, and how they fit into the plot. I thoroughly enjoyed this one, and until the very end it looked as if I was going to be right, but as always she pulls the rug out at the very end. I have one complaint which is the resolution. She's done this a couple of times but the resolution is very abrupt and convenient. It's not a major deal but it does suck you out a bit at the end.

But as expected, it was another great outing with Poirot. What's interesting about this one however, is that we spend a lot of time building to the circumstances of the crime itself. Instead of a murder happening in the first ~50 pages, we spend time with a variety of characters unsure of whether a crime will actually be committed. Poirot trying to prevent a crime he knows will occur at some point was an unexpected change of pace I really appreciated. Of course, this wouldn't be Agatha Christie without a crime so we get there eventually, but you'll appreciate the buildup of the world and characters. What I found the most surprising, was that even though I expected the crime, I was still blown away by the resolution. That's just a testament to how great Christie was, even 18 books into the series. I'm really looking forward to continuing the series, and reaching the 50% mark!<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Poirot is the highlight, and we got a new side to him this time.<br/>+ The side characters had depth and were 3 dimensional.<br/>+ While the plot was ""expected"", I still throughly enjoyed the story and the resolution was fantastic as usual.<br/>+ Christie's writing is so digestable and it's so easy to binge read.<br/><br/>If you've read Poirot before, of course you should read this one!

This was incredible. I loved all of this. I'm only familiar with the highlights of the Arthurian legend, but this is really approachable regardless, even if you haven't read the first book. I chose to start here because I was in the mood for a character like Galahad. A young man who is burdened by his father's legacy but at his core is just a good man. While Galahad is certainly like he is in the stories (the most chivalrous and honorable knight), he also isn't without flaw. And that is one of Kristian's strengths, every character from the legend feels REAL. A lot of times the Arthurian stories feel stylized, and as a reader you feel distanced from the characters because it's hard to relate to them. But here, all of the characters feel like real people in British history. And that makes the story so much more relatable. There are definitely some valid criticisms to be made of this book (for example, this book focused on 1 overarching quest for a giant portion that felt it never ended), but in the end my love outweighs those criticisms. I loved the story, the characters and the whole journey. You know you've enjoyed something when you can look back at the start and end of the story, and sit back in awe with how far you've come. And let me tell you, the last battle (which was over 40 pages long), my heart didn't stop beating for the entire time. Pure edge of your seat adrenaline.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Relatable story and characters, that feel a real part of history.<br/>+ Well written dialogue and plot.<br/>+ Great action that has you at the edge of your seat.<br/>+ Approachable for fans of Arthurian legend or fans of the first book, without needing to be an expert of either.<br/><br/>I rounded up here, but this sits at a 4.5/5 for me. Everything I wanted from this book, I got. I would highly recommend this to any historical fiction, fantasy or Arthurian legend fan.

But I felt the mystery part of the plot kind of just ends at one point in the book and there isn't much fare around it. All the related threads are resolved quickly and cleanly, which left me unsatisfied. The rest of the plot was good and I feel those threads were really the core of what the book is meant to be about, the crime just being the driver to start it all.

It doesn't have the same fleshed out characters and complex plot that is in the full length novels which I think is Christie's skillset. Unlike Sherlock, Poirot short stories just kind of happen and are very forgettable. While even 17 books in, I can still remember tons of moments from the novels, as they make a much more lasting impression. After Murder in the Mews, I was happy to return to form here and I wasn't disappointed. There's a unique take/twist on the typical mystery here which was a nice change of pace. The characters were interesting, and the plot was deeper than expected. Bob the dog has to be the highlight. Christie's writing for the inner workings of a dog brain was full of dry humor and was such a treat in the story. Unfortunately, guessing the culprit this time around was much simpler than her previous stories. Without about 70 pages left something happens that just puts the answer right in your face. It was fun to feel like I finally guessed one of her endings! But even with another slight twist at the end, it lacked the usual punch at the end that I'm used to. That's okay though because it was still fun and I was enjoy spending time with Poirot.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ A different shade of Poirot in this one which had me invested in this different side of him.<br/>+ Side characters felt familiar but had their own twists to make them unique. Bob, Theresa, and Miss Peabody in particular.<br/>+ A different investigation setup than we're used to which was refreshing 17 books in.<br/>- The culprit was fairly obvious with the blatant dangling of the answer in the reader's face. This took away the punch much too early in the story.<br/><br/>Overall, another fun journey with Papa Poirot. While this didn't punch as hard, it was still enjoyable and I'm excited to read the next. Obviously if you've read the first 16 books, of course you're going to read this one. I would recommend some others if you're just looking to jump into Christie or Poirot however. <br/><br/>A couple of other notes: I really appreciated the little nods to previous investigations. It was a nice reward for reading the other stories. And if you've read my other reviews for Poirot, you might be surprised to see no complaints about Hastings! Well he actually wasn't annoying in this one and played much more of the Watson role and that was really great!",,,1,0

Not because it was bad (I loved Riyria Revelations and Sullivan's writing), this was just a lot more setup and not a lot happening. It took a while before Royce and Hadrian were really introduced to each other, and the side story of setting up Gwen also took a lot of time. I love all these characters, but I think I went into this expecting the similar fare that I'm used to, and we're not quite there yet (operative word being yet). But let me tell you, once things get going, Sullivan is still at his best writing both the characters and the action. You can't stop from continuing to read and just enjoying getting to experience the story. Regardless of this, I love Royce and Hadrian and I can't wait for the next books and their future adventures before we see them again in Revelations.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ While of course Royce and Hadrian are not the same as they are in Revelations because it's 12 years younger, but they still feel so similar.

It feels like reading the first in an entire series instead of really book 7 in release order. If you're just starting here, I think it'll be totally normal for you, but as a long time reader I think you'll feel the same. Because of this there also feels like not much going on. The characters need to get together and the plot is just a way to get there. I think this will improve going forward as well because the adventures will matter.<br/>- The pacing is rather slow. It picks up in the last 50 pages or so, but before that it's a lot of switching perspectives with not much happening (or at least important things happening). I don't think this will be a problem going forward as the characters have kind of come together so to speak but it's present in this book.<br/><br/>Overall, this review sounds really mixed, and maybe it is. But, I love these characters, and this world. I'm really excited where we're going to get to, we just had to get by this initial setup. If you've never read any Sullivan book, you should fix that immediately. And as some others have said, this may be a better starting point for Riyria than Revelations.

I've found that I really love classic mysteries, especially short stories, and this was no different. Hanvey is such a fun and unique character that was incredibly refreshing. The stories were incredibly fun and there was some unique takes on the mysteries as well. Half the time as the reader you had no idea what Hanvey was up to but that made you more invested in the outcome. I've heard Cohen's other works aren't as good and have some blatant racism, but none of that appeared here. Definitely worth checking this out if you're a fan of the golden age of mysteries.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Hanvey is such a unique and interesting character. He's much different than most detectives.<br/>+ The mysteries are mostly unique and they're a bit different than the usual. I was invested in every one and I really was interested in where they were going to go.<br/>+ The characters were unique too. Like the classics the bad guys or thieves weren't necessarily bad. There was respect between Hanvey and the culprit which made for a unique dynamic.<br/><br/>This one was relatively short, with about 8 mysteries. But I thoroughly enjoyed every one. I'm looking forward to checking out more classics and checking out some of the Hanvey novels. I would highly recommend to mystery fans.

But with one of the most mind boggling endings I've read in a long time. This book builds tension and atmosphere really well, making you feel what it would have been like to be trapped on a cursed ship in the middle of the ocean. The story is really interesting, with multiple ongoing mysteries at a time. The characters breath life into the ship and really help shape the world of the novel. For most of this novel, it was sitting at about 4-5 stars and while the initial reveal didn't hit me in an awe defining way, there was a unseen twist that actually made it considerably good. However, within the last 15-20 pages, I felt the author threw all that away for no logical reason I can come up with. It felt contradictory to the characters and to the story, leaving me feeling incredibly unresolved and unsatisfied. Not every book needs to end the way you want it to, but, the ending should still make sense and satisfy the story. I didn't feel that happened here. It felt it threw away all the growth the characters had throughout the story. That hurts more considering how much I enjoyed the rest of the book. It seems this is similar to the author's other works which is unfortunate.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ The main characters are really good. They have a mix of personalities, some mirroring each other with slight changes. They add a lot of depth which makes the ship feel really filled out. <br/>+ The story has many parts, and I was invested in where each storyline was going. Some of the reveals were okay, but they still enriched the story.<br/>+ The feeling of the story is done really well. You can feel the tension and the mystery. The melting pot of personalities adds to that.<br/>- The ending is so contradictory to me. It felt like it threw away all of the reveals and character growth that existed in the story. <br/><br/>So why did this end at 3 stars instead of 4 or 5? Well, had this been just a story or a piece of literary fiction, the ending might not have bothered me as much. But a mystery is all about the reveal and ending. You invest in the story to get the experience of that revelation. When the reveal and ending is not good, it feels like the investment isn't worth it. It feels like you wasted your time. And that hurts. But overall this was still written really well and I enjoyed most of it. If you can forgive an arguably bad ending, I would recommend this. There's a lot to like here. Maybe you will even like the ending! I'll still pick up the author's other popular work, but I think I'll go in with lowered expectations for the end.",,,1,0

Average is such an intriguing character who's dry humor still brings a smile to my face almost 100 years later. The side characters bring depth to the stories and the world as well. I really wish there were more stories and/or a full novel with Average as the main characters, but, I'm happy I got these stories regardless.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Average is a fun character.

I wish we got to explore more of him.<br/>+ The side characters fill out the world in the individual stories as well as the wider plotline.<br/>+ I really felt like I was in the time period with the characters. <br/>+ A unique twist on the detective story using advertisements and creating characters who were similar to the Golden Age detective and Sherlock, but unique enough they didn't feel derivative.<br/><br/>So why only 4 stars? While I had a bunch of fun with this one, none of the stories are distinctly memorable since I wasn't surprised at the resolutions (or didn't have the association of trying to guess the culprit like a traditional novel).

This was mostly good. The book is written well, the main characters are well realized (and will feel familiar if you've read or watched modern police procedurals). I had some gripes with some side characters and the resolution but this was solid regardless. An important note: I have not read the first book but I didn't feel lost at all. There's references to the first book, but nothing that makes you feel left out so you can definitely read as a standalone.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Cassie is an intriguing character. She's at a point of her career where she's built the skills to be a good detective, but she's still learning some of the finer details which will make her come into her own. She never feels petulant or annoying (even with her short temper), she feels like a real modern member of the police.<br/>+ The premise of the book is really interesting and I had fun seeing the investigation progress.<br/>+ Most of the side characters were good. They each had a part to play in the story and even put Cassie in a bit of a mentor role. Warman and Jackie are the highlights.<br/>- Jim North was beyond annoying, and it felt there were moments he was shoehorned in just to be annoying. I get why he is the way he is, but by the 75% mark I was already beyond annoyed.<br/>- The resolution just kind of happens out of nowhere. It isn't that you couldn't see how it happened, but it just pops up in a chapter and you get the explanation later. It felt forced and not like a natural progression of the story.<br/>- The story felt a bit long. The number of pages were fine, but once I was at around ~80%, I was expecting to hit the point of the fast paced wrap up of the story that is common in most mysteries, but I did not. It still felt like the story was in the middle and then we were just at the end and not that the evidence drove the conclusion. <br/><br/>As you can see, I'm a bit mixed. This is a solid mystery read, but I don't think it'll blow your socks off. There's enough good here to recommend to mystery fans, and of course readers of the series.

She's an incredibly consistent writer, and there's always something new to enjoy in each book. I have gripes of course, but it's clear it's just the style of how she wanted to tell the story. If I can look past that, which to be fair aren't that annoying, the meal and dessert that are these books are just plain awesome. If you haven't read a Christie book, or more specifically Poirot, do yourself a favor and change that. Part of what makes classic mysteries so special is that they're just pure fun. They can certainly deal with heavy topics, and obviously include murder, but they put a focus on comic relief and have characters that are special and a joy to be around. This book has all of these, and so does all the other Poirot books. So read em!<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Poirot is still a joy. He never gets old.<br/>+ Nurse Leatheran is a fun character to be around. She's a serious character, and provides some dry comic relief throughout the story. But she's also a great sidekick.<br/>+ An expected yet unexpected reveal. I can't say more for spoilers, but while I figured it out, I didn't! A good trick in this one to me.<br/>+ A mysterious cast of characters. Classic Christie style where multiple people have a legitimate motive and I was eager to learn all their backstories.<br/>- Classic Christie doing a lot of setup before the real mystery begins. It's not poorly written or boring, but waiting a hundred pages for Poirot to show up in the story gets old really quick.<br/><br/>Simply, another great hit. If you read all my reviews for the series you'll know this is pretty standard. Agatha Christie and I just have a connection. She understands just what I like and always delivers.

There are moments where it feels like a chapter was a part of two different writing sessions. You'll read a paragraph where Mikaela says something, and then regurgitates the same thought or explanation 2 paragraphs later just in a slightly different way.<br/>- Brodie is inconsistently Scottish again. It's better than book 1, but still noticeable. Maybe it's only supposed to be when he's angry?<br/>- The culprit is fairly obvious considering the confines of the story and available suspects. The resolution was really rushed in explaining the reasoning in the last chapter which was slightly annoying.<br/>- We spend so much time talking about Brodie's mysterious backstory with barely any dog fooding of hints or information that it starts to make me care much less about what it actually is. It's hinted at so many times in this story with no push towards revelation that it feels like the reveal is going to be disappointing and something really as simple as one case that he disagreed with and walked away.<br/><br/>So why 3 stars? Because again, if you approach this as a purely cozy and popcorn flick style, it's enjoyable enough to have some fun. But I wouldn't go into this expecting to be blown away. I had plenty to complain about here while reading, but I still read the whole thing and enjoyed it overall. If you read book 1, it's more of the same and if you're looking for a quick and easy cozy, I'd recommend this to you. I'll likely keep picking up the books in the series as I need a palette cleanser.",,,1,0

It's frankly one of my favorite stories ever. It has everything you could want: good villain, intriguing main characters, a romp of a story, action and of course some romance too. It obviously has some dated dialogue and sentiments, but it's just fun from start to finish. To me, this is what a classic is, a story you can enjoy and feel regardless of when it released, and it still hits you the same way.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Percy is such a great character. He's dynamic and mysterious, keeping the reader on their toes, never knowing what he'll say or do next.<br/>+ Chauvelin is a great villain. The tense moments created with him in the room have you on the edge of your seat.<br/>+ The side characters have a nice role in the story and it's fun watching them simp over The Scarlet Pimpernel.<br/>+ Percy and Marguerite have such good chemistry. Every scene between them you can feel the tension and emotion between them. Their story is such a great subplot. The scene after the party when they're outside is just *chef's kiss*.<br/>- A bunch of antisemitic remarks in the story. Unfortunately a standard of the time. There's one section of the story that contains a lot, but the rest doesn't have anything really.<br/><br/>Overall, I love this book. I love the writing, story, and characters. The story feels really personable even for being 100 years old, and I would highly recommend people read this, especially if you appreciate classics. Also, if you haven't, I highly recommend watching the movie with Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon. It's not a direct adaptation, but it keeps so much of the core and heart of the story. I prefer it much more than the one from the 80s or 90s, and it evokes the same feeling the book did for me. I look forward to my next reread!",,,2,0

The last short story in this one brought the rating down a little bit for me. It was by no means bad, but the middle had so much mathematical theory that distracted from the mystery that it wasn't as enjoyable as the rest. One thing I want to definitely point out is, to me, the ""American Sherlock"" comparisons are a bit unfair to the author and the character. Saying Craig Kennedy is a Sherlock rip off is like saying someone who can throw a football is Tom Brady. My point is, sure are there similarities? Absolutely. But they're entirely different personalities, with different approaches to problems and solutions. I will say the format is very similar for how the short story is told, but every story has a beginning, middle and end. So don't go into this thinking this is American Sherlock. Go in expecting a fun set of stories with two likable main characters!<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Craig and Walter have great chemistry and are fun characters to be around. They're very personable and how they approach cases is fresh.<br/>+ Very varied cases with topical stories of the time (Typhoid Mary, The Black Hand).<br/>+ The middle sections of the short stories are the best as you learn about inventions of the time and how he uses science to solve the case.<br/>- 1 or 2 instances of racist language. Not excusable but this was from the early 1900s and the Library of Congress Crime Classics edition keeps it in.<br/>- Last story was more meh.<br/><br/>Overall, a very enjoyable experience. The late 19th and early 20th century authors really know how to write great short story mysteries. It's something I wish there was more of today. I would highly recommend if you like classic mysteries and want some stories that were very topical for the time! 4/5 stars. I'll definitely check out the novels.

Unlike The Big Four which felt like a departure from the normal style, this takes a story that seems much less grounded than usual, and turns it into a very personal story. It has everything you could want (or sometimes not if you're like me): Hastings, Papa Poirot, Japp, twists and turns, and good character work. But even with things that I normally wouldn't appreciate, the story is so good here that it overrides those negatives. If you haven't been spoiled, skip the adaptations and read this book. You'll be pleasantly surprised at the twist on a serial killer story. Maybe the reveal isn't as impactful today because these types of stories have been told so many times, but you'll appreciate how unique this was at the time (and hopefully surprised as well). <br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Poirot at the top of his game.<br/>+ Good side characters.<br/>+ Unique story with a nice twist.<br/>+ Tense story and pacing, making you anticipate the shoe drop.<br/>+ Perspective changes which was a nice change of pace.<br/><br/>Overall, this was another banger.

Being able to create interesting characters, mystery and resolution all in 30 pages or less must be quite a challenge. Astro and Valeska are such fun characters and while not all the mysteries are amazing, they're all really fun and there are some great ones in there.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Astro is such an intriguing character. He feels like a more modern and social Holmes. He has great wit and is very intelligent.<br/>+ Astro's relationship with Valeska was so refreshing. Sure, there was some romance there. BUT, Astro never puts Valeska down. He's constantly trying to train and challenge her so that she could be the best version of herself. He also actively relies on her during investigations and for his ""day job"".<br/>+ Mysteries are mixed in style, hitting all the notes for mystery fans. Murders, robberies, missing persons, etc.<br/>- Some racist language (unfortunately to be expected in stories that are 100 years old). I can only remember a couple of times in all 462 pages.<br/>- Not as many memorable short stories.

Honestly this can be read as a stand-alone if you’re interested in giving this series a shot but don’t want to get into a full novel. Definitely recommend the series if you’re into mysteries and Ancient Rome. <br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Leonidas and Cassia have good development in this.<br/>+ Side characters are solid, and show the true character of the characters.<br/>+ An enjoyable mystery, fairly obvious but that’s okay since it’s a novella with limited cast.<br/>+ Good morally ambiguous ending.<br/>- One of the resolutions is a bit far fetched to me.

I'm sad that it's over, but I'm so happy I took the ride. There's no need for me to regurgitate how important Sherlock Holmes is. But these stories are personal to me as I'm a major mystery lover. I love trying to solve the problem along with the detective. In fact, I actually really see some of myself in Holmes. Like Sherlock, I also need constant brain stimulation. I also need to solve problems, and it enjoy it for the game's sake and not for any recognition (nowhere near as talented clearly). Now, unlike Sherlock, I don't have some of the same faults with drugs for example. All of this to say this entire journey felt really special to me. It's clearly a classic and I would recommend readers give it a shot, especially the short stories. But, beyond that, if you're someone like me, or someone that feels disconnected from others and the world, give Sherlock a chance. You may find yourself connecting with him, Watson, and finding that even if you feel alone, there's a place for you in this world.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Sherlock and Watson. Plain and simple, they are just the best and have great chemistry. Watson's self awareness and knowledge of his role in their working relationship is vastly better than Poirot and Hastings for example. Also, the increased depth of personal relations between the two was awesome.<br/>+ The variety of stories. Some stories coming from Sherlock's perspective, some resulting in Sherlock deciding what he believes justice should be, and all around good crime variety.<br/>+ A continued variety of characters in the stories with different roles, including police other than Lestrade.<br/>+/- My only real complaint is that the collection just sort of ends. There's no clear final story where it's ""the final case"". But maybe that's okay. Maybe it lets us know Watson had some untold stories left, or that Sherlock continued to solve minor problems in his retirement. But in my heart I know I would've appreciated a ""fin"" moment of closure.<br/><br/>There's not much else to say, it's Sherlock and if you're a mystery fan you should try it. There's tons of great short stories, and the novels are fun (although be prepared for perspective changes before the solution is revealed). Even if you're not, I'd recommend it. Doyle created memorable characters, and you may find yourself connecting to them regardless. I know I certainly did! 5/5, highly recommend and I look forward to rereading again in the future.",,,1,0

As I'm sure is common with everyone, this time of the year gets quite busy with the holidays and travel so dedicated reading time is harder to find. These types of books are perfect because they aren't too deep but are still fun and quick reads. I read the first book a while ago but I didn't feel lost here, so it's easy to pick up. You could read it as a standalone and not really be lost.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Characters are fun and enjoyable. Sometimes they stretch a little beyond belief where they have the perfect backstory or skillset for a specific situation, but they don't break the flow of the book.<br/>+ Fast paced with easily digestible prose.<br/>+/- The mystery is fairly obvious. The cast of suspects isn't that large and it's easy to put the pieces together. However, this is a cosy so it isn't trying to stump the reader.<br/>- My only real ""criticism"" is it's not clear to me why Thea and Leslie aren't just together. There's no clear obstacles but this is really minor.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an enjoyable cosy read. It won't blow your socks off, but it'll keep you entertained throughout the ride. I'll definitely keep picking up books in this series.",,,1,0

I did have some minor gripes with this one (not really anything to do with the story itself) but it was still a great experience overall.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Evan is still such a fun main character. Incredibly smart, but also flawed, making him a very believable character.<br/>+ Evan's collaboration with others is always a treat.<br/>+ Evan's introspection and growth in this book. This story is personal to him, and gets him to reflect on himself, his role at the university, and his future.<br/>+ The crime was much more nuanced around this time. I have no problems reading about serial killers like book 1, but I appreciate mixed criminology in a series, and this one definitely took some unexpected twists that made this a different mystery than the first.<br/>- I would have liked more Addie and Patrick in this one. Unlike book 1 where their collaboration was very intertwined, this feels much more like Evan's story that happens to involve the police instead of the other way around. This wasn't bad, but it felt much more like all of the plot revolved around this with the occasional appearance with some information for Evan.<br/>- The resolution between characters felt a little forced and awkward to me. I'm being deliberately vague here to avoid spoilers. I didn't mind where the relationships ended up, but it really didn't feel natural to me from where we started to where we ended. Especially considering how just out of the blue and fast everything was.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this ride once again just like book 1, although I'd say on my initial read of this I enjoyed it a little less than book 1. I had more noticeable gripes in this one compared that made this more of a mixed bag trending towards great. I'll definitely continue in the series, and I think my gripes will not be repeated in the next adventure.",,,1,0

Going into this, I was worried I wouldn't like this much as much as I've enjoyed the Sherlock adaptations and pastiches I've read already. But this was so awesome! It still holds up today, and really set the standard for what detective fiction could be: interesting characters, an intriguing mystery with unexpected resolutions. The second set of short stories were amazing, and I think better than the first set. This makes some sense since they came out later where Doyle had more experience. The novels were classic, and the Hound of the Baskervilles told it's story in an unexpected way which was really interesting. Highly recommend for any fellow Sherlockian or someone looking to try classic detective fiction.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Sherlock and Watson at their best. Watson is such a great side character who although is meant to be the reader's gateway, stands on his own (see Hound of the Baskervilles). He's a much better side character than Hastings from Poirot.<br/>+ The stories are varied and explore many different themes.<br/>+ The mysteries were complex and didn't always go the expected way.<br/>+ The volume was structured well by breaking up the novels with short stories.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this. I'm glad it wasn't a let down, and I've already started volume 2 with more stories I've never experienced before. I'm really looking forward to the experience! ",,,1,0

I have some gripes in this one but it didn't ruin the core mystery for me, and it definitely ended in an unexpected way.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ Poirot is always good, he's true to himself and it's always fun to watch him work out a problem.<br/>+ The mystery was great, and mostly unexpected. At the reveal at the end, all my theories came crumbling down in front of me. I really thought it was going one of two ways and even believed I was right towards the end, but nope! She hoodwinked me again.<br/>+ Christie's writing is great and her characters are always compelling. No matter the book length, they're quick reads.<br/>+ Some very unique characters in this one. Christie's characters are always good, but a couple in this were really of a different style which was refreshing.<br/>- I really am starting to dislike Hastings. There are moments where he's okay but he gets on my nerves more often than not now. He continually follows the same formula which is predictable and serves no other purpose than that. At least for Watson, he has a role in the medical side and for the most part supports Holmes. Hastings will go from one page thinking Poirot is a genius to the next thinking he's too old. What a flaky ""friend"".<br/><br/>A warning for those reading the books, there is some antisemitism in this book just like the last one unfortunately. I get a different time and all that but it felt truly unnecessary even in the story. <br/><br/>Overall, this was another great read with another great mystery.

Most historical mysteries set during the 1800s are set in England. I really appreciate a new location with it's own society structure and piece of history. Of course there are similarities, but they're things common of the time and not the place. The characters are fun and this definitely falls more on the cozy side, but I would definitely recommend if you're looking for something fun and relatively short.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>+ The characters are fun and engaging. It makes it feel like a filled out world. <br/>+ The setting is unique and comes with it own's interesting pieces (for example what those of Chinese descent experienced in this time period).<br/>+ The story is mostly engaging, there are definitely conveniences but it didn't detract from my enjoyment much.<br/>+ The pace is relatively fast, not much bumbling around.<br/>- The mystery ended up being relatively simple and quite obvious when you really think about it.<br/>- Parts of the story felt almost like it was going in one direction and then didn't. Maybe they were meant to be red herrings but it almost felt more jarring. It's possible this was me though (I've been reading a bunch of Christie and Sherlock).<br/><br/>Overall, this was fun and I enjoyed my time with it. I really think this is 3.25-3.5/5 stars but would recommend for someone looking for a quick and enjoyable read. I'll be continuing with the series for sure.",,,1,0

The characters are still great, Poirot being the best, but the story was weird as many reviewers have said already. Hastings was far less annoying in this one, especially since he's married so no more weird and annoying interactions with the female characters in the book. I actually didn't mind the idea of Poirot fighting against an international crime group. But the execution was rather odd. Some moments felt great, and very inline with Poirot. Others however, felt out of place and just didn't feel realistic. What makes Poirot, and Christie for that matter, is the realistic crimes which have well drawn and real characters who aren't perfect. It's not necessarily about Poirot outsmarting some supremely intelligent criminal a la Moriarty. He learns about all the characters, even the things they don't want to reveal, and puts the pieces together to understand who was capable of the crime and how they did it. Here though, there was just random things happening with no real thread to the overall plot and characters who only exist in the background.

But wow was this great. I've seen most of the adaptations (I'm partial to the Laurence Olivier and the 1980s adaptation) and thoroughly enjoyed them. I figured I would finally delve into the actual book and it was well worth it. I'd like to rewatch the adaptations to see if my opinion changes, but I can definitely see why the 1995 adaptation is well regarded (which I still really like).<br/><br/>Austen is frankly timeless. Her plotting, her characters, her world are believable no matter when you read it. I truly believe anyone can read and enjoy Austen. I think what's so special about Pride and Prejudice is just how real it feels. The growth of the characters individually and their relationship feel so realistic and natural. There's a moment later in the book where there's a slow down in pace so the characters and story can take a breath and reflect. If you do the same as a reader, you'll see how far you've already journeyed with the characters and how much time you have left. I've read plenty of romance, and a lot of times it feels very quick or the story itself takes place in such a short amount of time. But not here, everything flows perfectly. It's simply a classic.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>- Reading after seeing an adaptation enhances the experience since you have visual representations in your mind already.<br/>- I appreciated Jane much more in this, including her relationship with Elizabeth. In the adaptations, she tends to be somewhat of an afterthought in making Elizabeth the focus. But her secondary story is important and pivotal to Elizabeth.<br/>- The relationship, the growth and the pivotal scenes were all perfect.<br/>- Mr. Bennet definitely seems much more like a poor father than in some of the adaptations.<br/>- Timeless classic.<br/><br/>What else is there to say, it's a classic for a reason. I've ordered the rest of Austen's work (which I've seen many more adaptations for) and I'm excited to continue exploring her important contributions to literary history. It's sad to think about that she never truly got to see her own success and how much her work has meant to generations of people.",,,1,0

If for some reason you read my review for book 1 in this series, my biggest struggle with the book was that it seemed like the story meandered for most of the book. It frankly didn't seem like it knew where it was going. That certainly is not the case here, which was my expectation after reading book 1 and some of the author's previous works.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>- Cassia and Leonidas have great chemistry and bounce so well off each other.<br/>- Each of the side characters felt like they had purpose in the overall story, compared to book 1 where they felt shoehorned in.<br/>- The plot was much more focused and driven.<br/>- I sort of predicted what the resolution of the mystery was which took some of my enjoyment away. It wasn't necessarily obvious, but it was like weirdly stressed which to me made it clear.<br/>- Development between Cassia and Leonidas was really enjoyable. <br/>- The ending seems somewhat silly to me. I like the development for Leonidas but it's clearly not going to stay that way as it defeats the purpose of the series...<br/><br/>I did not get my resolution with Regulus as I would've liked, but he wasn't annoying in this book so I wasn't upset. I do wish the side characters had some larger roles as I'd like to learn more about them. Overall though, this was very enjoyable and I think it's a solid historical mystery.

It meandered a lot and the plot didn't really seem like it knew where it wanted to go. It felt like it took until ~65% before the story figured out what it wanted to be. Once it was more focused, the mystery was solid.<br/>- Awesome time period to explore.<br/>- Regulus, Regulus, Regulus. I've read the author's Captain Lacey series and he's a very similar character to Colonel Brandon. My biggest gripe in that series was the drama and problems were dragged on far too long and didn't make for an enjoyable subplot for the main character. Regulus is similar to Brandon for Leonidas and I'm concerned it'll be the same format here. Things don't need to be resolved in 1 paragraph, but 5+ books is overkill.<br/><br/>As you can tell, I'm somewhat mixed. I enjoyed the characters, the time period and the story (once it figured out where to go), but, there was a lot that took away from the enjoyment too. The writing is solid and this is an okay start to a new series. I enjoyed the author's other series and I will be continuing to book 2 here.",,,1,0

It picked up significantly in the last third and brought this to 4.25. While there is definitely mystery central to the plot, I would classify this more as 60% historical fiction and 40% mystery. There’s a lot of great information about the time period and descriptions of London. The distinction of the percentages is important because the mystery doesn’t really get into gear for a while and you may be disappointed otherwise. The mystery was pretty solid overall.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>- Easily digestible prose, which makes for a fast read.<br/>- Characters had to deal with complex decisions, although I did feel a couple of them didn’t marinate for long enough. Presented and then quickly resolved.<br/>- One of the best descriptions of a place I’ve read. I could really picture London and especially the core places of the story.<br/>- No character is perfect, all dealing with complex things that impact them. This makes for a more believable story.<br/>- Some resolutions were a little too fast, as we weren’t dealing with a detective, I wish we spent more time considering options.<br/><br/>Overall, a good reading experience. I’m looking forward to the next book and would recommend for historical fiction and mystery fans.",,,1,0

A play on classic court style.<br/>- Great characters with depth, each getting their moment to play their role.<br/>- I struggled with pacing in some sections.

There’s a lot going on in the first half of the book and then kicks into high gear after 50%. I have a couple of gripes but thoroughly enjoyed my time and experience with Simon and Sophie.<br/><br/>Quick hits:<br/>- Simon and Sophie feel like real people that could’ve existed. Both grappling with their own demons as well as their relationship. Let me tell you, chapter 26 had the most tension and angst between two characters I’ve read in recent memory (I mean this in the best way).<br/>- There a couple of moments which took me out of the story quickly like Simon putting his gun away and then two paragraphs later the same type of sentence occurs with no reference to his gun coming back out. Minor gripe.<br/>- The very end resolved pretty quickly and left some things open I would’ve liked resolved. I’m assuming this may be to leave the door open for another book in this universe (like London Restoration). <br/>- The scenery was described so well. I could imagine Vienna post world war 2, stuck in the middle of destruction and rebuilding. <br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend this, especially for fans of historical fiction. The world is well described, the characters are believable, and their journey throughout this book is the type you love to see in a relationship: emotion, angst, and happiness.",,,1,0

She plays well off of Vonvault and Bressinger (even Radomir).<br/>- I felt sometimes Helena was a little too immature and petulant. The love story was honestly meh, not bad but just there. None of these are really too often or present and doesn’t take away from the story.<br/>- Complex political landscape with a lot of moving pieces.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great fantasy debut. I enjoyed my time reading it and would definitely recommend. Due to some of the stuff with Helena bringing me down slightly, and the mystery being resolved earlier than I was expecting, it wasn’t fully 5 stars. But still dope!<br/><br/>P.S. I would caution going into this book with no expectations. It’s getting comparisons to a lot of different things (which happens to every book), but I think going in blind is best.

There were sections I was really invested, but then sections where I wasn’t. This is more of a character and world driven story than plot driven. I went into this hoping to dig into a cool mystery (my favorite genre) with interesting characters in a cool world. I got some of that. The world is really really cool and it’s history and role in the story was awesome. The characters were kind of interesting. There were some common archetypes, but they each had a purpose and role to play so all the perspectives felt important. So why 2 stars?

It’s not bad but it’s not good. The world is unique and so is it’s history and prevalence in the story, but the rest is just okay at best. The writing is good and very easily digestible, but couldn’t save the mystery’s resolution and what I felt was a cheap ending. If you’re interested in unique worlds, it may be worth a try for you.

Mundt, Fielder, Control and Alec were great. But boy oh boy did Liz suck. She was an absolute plant to drive the end of the story and that’s it. First off, of course she has to sleep with Alec because what else could a woman serve in a story right? Then, after spending essentially a small number of time together with little dialogue, I’m supposed to believe she’s in love with Alec. Seriously? Come on. At this point I’m thinking she just doesn’t have an important role (spoilers, I was wrong). She eventually gets a letter from the Centre which she clearly doesn’t think is real or a good idea to accept, but has to convince herself to accept because how else would the story get resolved? This was all a setup for her being the witness against Alec at the end. I was so aggravated at that point I didn’t even get a chance to appreciate an actual good plot twist! The ending for Alec was a good bookend but a lot of that last section sucked because of the shoehorning of Liz’s character. When she gets the letter, she clearly displays she’s an intelligent character (which is honestly great because we need more well written female characters in fiction) but Carre had to essentially just push her character against herself to get her where she needed to be for the climax and resolution. All of this and nevermind the fact that Alec who’s a seasoned spy with an agreed upon elaborate plan to take down Mundt decides as all men, he can’t keep it in his pants so he sleeps with a random woman. I get this is a product of its time, but for me it didn’t excuse some of the blaring problems. <br/><br/>So how is this 3 stars after this rant? Because the rest was sooooooo good. The tension, the story, the villains and antagonists felt real and well developed. I felt what it would’ve been like in the Cold War. I enjoyed all of that so much, it salvages the rating and book for me. I’ll still be checking out Carre’s other works (I really like Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy), but this one kind of sits in the middle for me.<br/><br/>Overall, I’d still recommend if you like suspense and spy thrillers. The stuff I mentioned probably won’t bother others as much.",true,,1,0

Sometimes I like to start after the first couple books in a series to see if I like the writing and characters minus some of the early setup and character development (I go back and read the previous books after!). <br/><br/>This book starts off as a seemingly very small and easy mystery but quickly grows into something much larger. It involves a murder that’s steeped in the politics of the time. My only real criticism of this book was the length of the mystery. The suspect pool is small and while the resolution was great and made sense, it was still very easy to guess as it realistically could only have been less than a handful of people. <br/><br/>The biggest strength to me in this book was the characters and the balance between their stories. St. Mars and Mrs. Kean have their own plot lines which do overlap, but are also separate. It felt like they were two characters who were experiencing their own lives but existing in the same story. In many mysteries, this isn’t the case. The two main characters typically spend all their time together and while they have backstories, that’s all they are, backstories. This actually felt like I was experiencing two people who have backstories but have ongoing stories as well. <br/><br/>Overall, I loved this book. It was well researched and well written. I would recommend this to any fan of mystery. I can’t wait to read the other books!",,,1,0
